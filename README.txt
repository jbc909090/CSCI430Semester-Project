the code is in nf6610wt in a folder called project2stage2

folder may be capitalized

Just run 

javac WareContext.java
javac cart.java
javac WaitList.java
javac ClientList.java
ls

ls will list the files in the folder if they do not all have .class files by this point then run javac for that file
(im sorry its like that but for me the .class files have been very unwilling to be created and i do not understand why)
(which .class files are created seemed very random so please just check i ran a bunch of commands and those were the most helpful commands and should get all the .class files but i think exactly 1 .class file didnt get made and i couldnt explian why)
then once all files have a .class file, run
java WareContext

you should begin in manager to create products and suppliers and assign products to suppliers
then in clerk you can create a few clients
and client you can fill up carts and make orders

ALSO NOTE ALL IDS START WITH 1, EXCEPT INVOICE IDS THEY START AT 10001
