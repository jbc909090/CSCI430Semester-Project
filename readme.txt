This is A way for me to store an old group/solo project (first half was in group the rest was solo)
As such the project is older than it appears, this is from 4/4/2021

download all the files and make sure you have have some accesible x11 server
then in the folder with all the files run
javac WareContext.java
then run
java WareContext
this will take a bit but then the GUI will appear, every user input is done via GUI
every output is via text in the command line so check there for things such as the lsit of clients with outstanding balances
